# Wordle! (wordle project)


Wordle project

## Work Plan

Row's 3 & 4 set height and width for the number of guesses and length of the words which we will use in a function to create our game-board.

LIST OF VALID WORDS put into object of strings to which we can use for our random generated secret word.

 1st FUNCTION: Created for the board to display on the webpage, While the 1st for loop is setting the hight of the game-board, The 2nd for loop is setting the width of the game-board.

 creating elements and pending empty boxes to the board by using (box.innerText = '') to set an empty string and getting elementById to appendChild (box) to the parent board.

 All the while setting the css as i go to set style for the boxes with height, width, and color, also setting it for inner text to be centered when inserted once game is in action.
