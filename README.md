#**_My first Project_**
This is my 1st project for the Software Engineering Immersive programe with General Assembly Australia.
This project was structured to engage not only all the learning that we have had since beggining the program, But also to see if i could push past my limits.

:thinking: I ran into a few problems along the way and still currently have a problem with the box's changing to green if the letter is in the word twice and is in the correct position.
I realise the problem was using data-key making things harder for myself to work with i know with this perticular project i could have used (class) and (id) to be able to iterate through the logic easier, and being able to read duplicate leters in the word. :thinking: 

I am open for any tips if there are any which i am sure there are in assisting me to being able to complete this step.

I also ran into a problem with setting color to the keys once selected not changing color and have not been able to affectivly render that problem.

I also ran into a problem with the delete button when i was pressing the delete buttonn on the key board it was deleting the entire contents of the page.
